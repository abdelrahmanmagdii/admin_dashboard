# Flutter Community Admin Dashboard


The Flutter Community provides several packages to the community and pub. dev that all differ in regards to maintenance requirements.

The Flutter Community admins struggle to keep up with all of the changes, releases, changelogs, and activities on all packages. Two of the biggest challenges include keeping track of releases, as well as the inability to allow maintainers to trigger package releases on pub. dev without giving them super admin access.

To solve this, we are looking to implement a Flutter Community Dashboard that assists admins by rounding up and providing the admins with information regarding issues, latest activities on repositories, maintainers, level of access and implementing a trigger to build and deploy to pub.dev, and more.
